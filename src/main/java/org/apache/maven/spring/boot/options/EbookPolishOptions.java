 * <p>Polishing books is all about putting the shine of perfection onto your carefully crafted e-books.</p>
 * <p>Polishing tries to minimize the changes to the internal code of your e-book. Unlike conversion, 
 * it does not flatten CSS, rename files, change font sizes, adjust margins, 
 * etc. Every action performs only the minimum set of changes needed for the desired effect.</p>
 * <p>You should use this tool as the last step in your e-book creation process.</p>
 * <p>Note that polishing only works on files in the AZW3 or EPUB formats.</p>

Or if the book embeds the bold and italic versions of a font, but bold and italic text is relatively rare, or absent altogether, then the bold and italic fonts can either be reduced to only a few characters or completely removed. The only downside to subsetting fonts is that if, at a later date you decide to add more text to your books, the newly added text might not be covered by the subset font.</p>
